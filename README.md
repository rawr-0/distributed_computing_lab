# distributed_computing_lab
The student project is designed to apply the knowledge and skills learned in distribution systems practice. The project is developed using Python programming language and leverages various libraries such as threading, asyncio, and Tornado web to enable efficient communication and data exchange between different nodes in a network.

The project comprises of both server and client components that can establish connections and exchange messages. One of the main features of the project is its ability to automatically reconnect when the "server" node dies, ensuring the system is always up and running. Additionally, the project uses a binary tree topology, which allows for efficient communication and data exchange between nodes in the network.

Overall, this student project demonstrates the practical application of distribution systems concepts, including communication protocols, network topologies, and fault tolerance mechanisms, using Python programming and various libraries.
